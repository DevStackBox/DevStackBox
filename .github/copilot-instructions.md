## 🚀 Overview

DevStackBox is a lightweight, portable, open-source local development environment for PHP developers.  
It is built with Tauri for a smaller, faster, and more native experience, using a modern, maintainable frontend stack.  
All documentation, project management, and bug reporting are via GitHub.

**Key stack points:**
- All backend/service management runs in Rust via Tauri.
- The frontend is a Vite-powered React app, styled with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui, using Framer Motion for animations.
- No custom CSS unless absolutely necessary; dark/light mode is required everywhere.

---

## 🛠️ 1. Development Environment & Prerequisites

- **Primary OS:** Windows 11 (development and primary testing)
- **Editor:** Visual Studio Code (with Copilot extension)
- **Frontend:** Vite + React + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui + Framer Motion
- **Backend:** Tauri (Rust)
- **No custom CSS:** Use only Tailwind and shadcn/ui, document any CSS exceptions.
- **Dark/Light Mode:** All UI must fully support both (Tailwind/shadcn/ui patterns).
- **Auto-update:** App is auto-updated from GitHub Releases.

**Install:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ProgrammerNomad/DevStackBox.git
cd DevStackBox
pnpm install  # or npm/yarn
cargo install tauri-cli
pnpm tauri dev  # or npm run tauri dev
```

## 🧑‍💻 4. Copilot Usage & Prompt Patterns

- **Backend (Rust, src-tauri):**  
  _"Write a Tauri command to start MySQL and return its status to the frontend."_  
  _"Add a Tauri command to download additional PHP binaries via an in-app installer."_

- **Frontend (React, src/):**  
  _"Create a MySQL control panel using shadcn/ui, Tailwind, Framer Motion; support dark/light mode."_  
  _"Add a modal for backup/restore using shadcn/ui and Tailwind."_  
  _"Implement a language switcher with i18next and Unicode support for Hindi."_

- **Config & Logs:**  
  _"Show a real-time logs viewer with tabs for MySQL, Apache, PHP logs using Tailwind and xterm.js."_  
  _"Add config editor with Monaco and backup/restore UI using shadcn/ui."_

- **General:**  
  _"All UI must support dark/light mode and be styled only with Tailwind/shadcn/ui."_

---

## 📦 5. Binary Management

- **Default PHP:** Only **PHP 8.2** is bundled by default.
- **Other Binaries:** Downloadable on demand via the in-app distribution installer—do not bundle extra binaries by default.

---

## 💡 6. Detailed Copilot Examples

- _"Add a config editor with Monaco and backup/restore, styled with Tailwind and shadcn/ui, supporting dark/light mode."_
- _"Implement a logs viewer in React using xterm.js, with tabs for each service, filter and search, and animated transitions with Framer Motion."_
- _"Write a Tauri command in Rust to download and extract a PHP version into the php/ directory and notify the frontend on completion."_
- _"Create a modal with shadcn/ui for reporting bugs, which opens a GitHub Issue link with prefilled content."_
- _"Implement a multilanguage language switcher with i18next and Unicode support for Hindi, styled for header consistency."_

---

## 🌐 7. Multilanguage & Unicode

- Use i18next for all user-facing text (English & Hindi)
- Use Tailwind and system fonts for perfect Unicode/Devanagari rendering
- Language switcher must use Unicode names ("English", "हिन्दी") and consistent header styling

---

## 🎨 8. UI/UX & Styling Guidelines

- All UI styled only with Tailwind and shadcn/ui; do not use custom CSS unless essential and well-documented.
- All components must support both **dark and light mode** via Tailwind/shadcn/ui.
- Animations and transitions must use Framer Motion (not CSS keyframes or raw JS).
- Responsive, accessible, and visually consistent.
- Use shadcn/ui dialogs, modals, menus everywhere possible.

---

## 🖥️ 9. Modern Menu & Navigation Patterns

**DevStackBox uses a combination of modern, desktop-inspired navigation patterns for clarity and usability:**

- **Sidebar Navigation (Primary):**  
  Use shadcn/ui's `NavigationMenu` or a custom sidebar for main sections (Dashboard, Projects, Services, Logs, Settings, About).  
  - Supports icons, labels, section grouping, and collapsible "rail" mode.  
  - **Copilot prompt:**  
    _"Create a sidebar menu with shadcn/ui and Tailwind, supporting dark/light mode and collapsible icons."_

- **Top Bar (Secondary):**  
  Place global actions (theme switcher, language selector, user menu, updates) in a sticky top bar above or beside the sidebar.  
  - **Copilot prompt:**  
    _"Implement a top bar with theme and language switchers, using shadcn/ui and Tailwind."_

- **Tabs (Sub-navigation):**  
  Use shadcn/ui's `Tabs` for sub-sections within a page (e.g., "Overview | Logs | Settings" for a given service).  
  - **Copilot prompt:**  
    _"Add tabs for logs and settings in a service detail view, using shadcn/ui Tabs."_

- **Context Menus:**  
  Use shadcn/ui's `ContextMenu` for right-click/“more” actions on project, database, or service items.  
  - **Copilot prompt:**  
    _"Add a context menu for each database row with edit/delete options using shadcn/ui."_

- **Command Palette:**  
  Add a command palette (Ctrl+P/Cmd+P) with shadcn/ui's `Command` for fast search, navigation, and command execution (power user feature).  
  - **Copilot prompt:**  
    _"Create a command palette using shadcn/ui Command for quick actions and navigation."_

- **Floating Action Buttons:**  
  For quick “add” actions (e.g., new project/database), use floating shadcn/ui `Button` with fixed positioning (optional, desktop only).

**Guidelines:**  
- All navigation must be accessible (keyboard, screen readers).
- Sidebar and command palette are primary navigation for all major DevStackBox features.
- Always use Tailwind and shadcn/ui components for styling and transitions (no custom CSS unless needed).

## � 12. Recent Achievements & Lessons Learned (v0.1.6)

**✅ Major Fixes Completed:**
- **MSI Compatibility**: Fixed version format from `0.1.0-alpha.6` to `0.1.6` for MSI bundler
- **File Structure**: Resolved accidental deletion of critical files (`globals.css`, `main.tsx`, `index.html`)
- **GitHub Actions**: Fixed emoji encoding issues causing PowerShell parsing errors
- **CSS Pipeline**: Restored complete Tailwind CSS compilation (27.60 kB output)
- **Build System**: Successfully generating both MSI (288.9MB) and NSIS (147.7MB) installers

**🎓 Key Lessons:**
- Always use clean semantic versioning for MSI compatibility (no hyphens, no text)
- Avoid emoji characters in PowerShell scripts for GitHub Actions
- Verify file locations before deletion - check if files are truly duplicates
- Root-level files may be the correct ones in Vite projects
- Test build output to ensure CSS is being compiled correctly

**🔧 Technical Improvements:**
- GitHub Actions workflow is now emoji-free and stable
- Proper project structure following Vite + React + Tauri best practices
- All source files correctly organized with proper import paths
- Build artifacts cleaned up for release preparation
